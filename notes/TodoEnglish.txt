ReadingTest 
-----------
40 questions | 60 minutes	
No additional time is given to transfer your answers at the end of 60 minutes

Section Focus
1
may contain two or three short texts relevant to basic linguistic survival in
English, such as public notices, advertisements and timetables

2
contains two texts which focus on the workplace environment, such as job
descriptions, contracts and staff development and training materials

3
one long text designed to test your ability to cope with longer, more complex
passages found in newspapers, magazines, and fiction and non-fiction book
extracts
	
	
Remember the IELTS General Training Reading Test gets more difficult as it goes on, so you
will probably need more time for the questions at the end than for those at the beginning.
Maybe a guideline could be:
17 minutes on section 1.
20 minutes on section 2.
23 minutes on section 3.
