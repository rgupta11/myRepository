AMI copy
- AWS does not copy launch permissions, user-defined tags, or Amazon S3 bucket permissions from the source AMI to the new AMI. 
After the copy operation is complete, you can apply launch permissions, user-defined tags, and Amazon S3 bucket permissions 
to the new AMI.
- S3 bucket name: amis-for-account-in-region-hash. For example: amis-for-123456789012-in-us-east-2-yhjmxvp6.

  Prerequisites
    - Prior to copying an AMI, you must ensure that the contents of the source AMI are updated to support running in a 
    different Region.
  Limits
    - DestinationRegionsarelimitedto50concurrentAMIcopies.
    - You cannot copy a paravirtual(PV) AMI to a Region that does not support PVAMIs
    - There is no limit to the number of AWS accounts with which an AMI can be shared.
